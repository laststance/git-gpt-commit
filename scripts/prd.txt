# Overview
Git GPT Commit is an AI-powered Git extension that automates the creation of meaningful, descriptive commit messages using OpenAI's GPT models. It analyzes staged changes and generates contextually appropriate commit messages, eliminating the need for developers to spend time crafting them manually. This tool improves development workflow efficiency, ensures consistency in commit message style, and enhances repository readability through high-quality, AI-generated commit messages.

# Core Features
## AI-Powered Commit Message Generation
- **What it does:** Automatically generates commit messages by analyzing staged git changes
- **Why it's important:** Saves developer time and mental overhead while ensuring high-quality, descriptive commit messages
- **How it works:** Extracts git diff content, processes it through OpenAI's API with optimized prompts, and returns a formatted commit message

## Multiple GPT Model Support
- **What it does:** Supports selection between different OpenAI models (gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4)
- **Why it's important:** Allows users to balance between performance, cost, and quality based on their specific needs
- **How it works:** Provides a configuration interface that persists model preferences per user

## Multi-Language Support
- **What it does:** Generates commit messages in different languages based on user preference
- **Why it's important:** Makes the tool accessible to global development teams who maintain repositories with non-English commit histories
- **How it works:** Configures the AI prompt with language instructions and maintains this preference in user settings

## Persistent User Configuration
- **What it does:** Saves user preferences (model choice, language setting) to eliminate repetitive configuration
- **Why it's important:** Provides a smooth, frictionless experience that respects individual developer preferences
- **How it works:** Stores configuration in the user's home directory as a JSON file that's automatically loaded on each use

## Seamless Git Integration
- **What it does:** Integrates directly with Git as a custom command
- **Why it's important:** Fits naturally into existing development workflows without requiring changes to habits
- **How it works:** Registers a custom git command that can be invoked via `git gpt commit`

# User Experience
## User Personas
- **Professional Developers:** Want to maintain clean, descriptive commit histories without the cognitive overhead of writing commit messages
- **Open Source Contributors:** Need to adhere to project commit message conventions without deep knowledge of the project's standards
- **Development Teams:** Require consistency in commit message style and quality across multiple contributors
- **Non-Native English Speakers:** Need assistance composing grammatically correct commit messages in English or prefer using their native language

## Key User Flows
1. **Basic Commit Flow:**
   - Developer makes code changes and stages them with `git add`
   - Developer runs `git gpt commit`
   - Tool generates a commit message based on the staged changes
   - Commit is created with the generated message

2. **Configuration Flow:**
   - Developer runs `git gpt model` to select their preferred AI model
   - Developer runs `git gpt lang` to set their preferred language
   - Developer runs `git gpt config` to view current settings
   - Preferences are saved for all future commits

## UI/UX Considerations
- Command-line interface follows Git conventions for familiarity
- Minimal configuration required for immediate productivity
- Clear feedback during message generation process
- Option to edit or regenerate unsatisfactory messages

# Technical Architecture
## System Components
- **CLI Interface:** Built with Commander.js for argument parsing and command structure
- **Git Integration:** Uses child_process to interact with Git commands and retrieve diff information
- **OpenAI Client:** Communicates with OpenAI API to generate commit messages
- **Configuration Manager:** Persists and retrieves user settings from the filesystem
- **Message Sanitizer:** Ensures generated messages adhere to commit message best practices

## Data Models
- **User Configuration:**
  ```json
  {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "language": "english"
  }
  ```
- **OpenAI Request:**
  ```json
  {
    "model": "<selected-model>",
    "messages": [
      { "role": "system", "content": "<instruction>" },
      { "role": "user", "content": "<git-diff>" }
    ],
    "temperature": 0,
    "max_tokens": 50
  }
  ```

## APIs and Integrations
- **OpenAI API:** For accessing various GPT models
- **Git Command Line:** For retrieving diff information and creating commits
- **Filesystem API:** For reading and writing configuration files

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Node.js runtime environment
- Git installation
- Internet connection for OpenAI API access
- OpenAI API key

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: Core Functionality Enhancement
- **Smart Commit Type Detection:** Automatically detect and apply conventional commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **Customizable Commit Templates:** Allow users to define their own commit message templates and formatting rules
- **Message Quality Settings:** Add options to control verbosity, detail level, and style of generated messages
- **Interactive Mode:** Provide an interactive mode that allows users to choose from multiple suggested commit messages
- **Offline Operation:** Add capability to fall back to a local, lighter model when internet connection is unavailable

## Phase 2: Extended Integrations
- **IDE Extensions:** Create plugins for popular IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains) to invoke the tool without leaving the editor
- **CI/CD Integration:** Provide hooks for continuous integration workflows to validate or generate commit messages
- **Custom OpenAI Endpoint Support:** Allow configuration of custom endpoints for organizations using private OpenAI instances
- **PR Description Generation:** Extend functionality to generate pull request descriptions based on all included commits
- **GitHub/GitLab Web Integration:** Support browser extensions to add functionality directly in web interfaces

## Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities
- **Commit History Analysis:** Generate insights and summaries from repository commit history
- **Codebase Understanding:** Improve commit message quality by building context awareness of the overall project
- **Multilingual Code Comments:** Generate or update code comments based on changes, supporting multiple languages
- **Commit Message Consistency Enforcement:** Validate manually written commit messages against project conventions
- **Release Notes Generation:** Automatically compile meaningful release notes from commits between versions

## Phase 4: Enterprise Features
- **Team Consistency Settings:** Allow team leads to define settings that apply to all team members
